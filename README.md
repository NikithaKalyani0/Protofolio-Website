# Protofolio-Website
A personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my background, education, skills, and projects. It features a clean and responsive design with smooth layout sections, including a photo, contact details, and project highlights. This project reflects my front-end development skills and creative approach to web design.
